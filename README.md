# Boston-House-Price-Prediction
House Price Predictions on "Boston Housing Dataset" using Linear Regression and Polynomial model..
It contains US census data concerning houses in various areas around the city of Boston. Each sample corresponds to a unique area and has about a dozen measures. We should think of samples as rows and measures as columns. The data was first published in 1978 and is quite small, containing only about 500 samples. 
Let us look at a few characteristics of the Dataset
1) Number of Instances: 506:
2) Number of Attributes: 13 numeric/categorical
predictive
3) Median Value (attribute 14) is usually the
target
It is based on CRIME per capita crime rate by town
The reason we are using this dataset is that it is small in number, well defined and we can perform linear regression based on the Crime
rate stats.
